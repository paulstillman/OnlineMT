# Online Moustracking

This is a space where all variables names and their definitions can go --> Noelle, could you do that?

Other tasks/points that came up while trying to use the R scripts on our test data (11.3.):

+ rename the "confusing" variable everywher in the scripts into "stimulus_type"/"condition" or some other better name to describe whether a stimulus is healthy or unhealthy
+ There are problems with the function describe_alerts
+ rename "sex" into "gender"
+ table1 cannot be coerced in dataframe --> why?
+ in data prep: something is wrong with the "wts" variable --> only has one level (in test data) but needs two --> this is why I removed this variable from the analysis
